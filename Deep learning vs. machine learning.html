<h2>Deep learning vs. machine learning:</h2>

Since deep learning and machine learning tend to be used interchangeably, it’s
 worth noting the nuances between the two. As mentioned above, both deep
 learning and machine learning are sub-fields of artificial intelligence, and deep
 learning is actually a sub-field of machine learning
 
 .
  Deep learning is actually comprised of neural networks.“Deep” in deep learning refers to a neural network comprised of more than three layers which would be inclusive of the inputs and the output can be considered a deep learning algorithm. This is generally represented using the following diagram:

   The way in which deep learning and machine learning differ is in how each algorithm learns. Deep learning automates much of the feature extraction piece of the process, eliminating some of the manual human intervention required and enabling the use of larger data sets. You can think of deep learning as "scalable machine learning" as Lex Fridman noted in same MIT lecture from above. Classical, or "non-deep", machine learning is more dependent on human intervention to learn. Human experts determine the hierarchy of features to understand the differences between data inputs, usually requiring more structured data to learn.

"Deep" machine learning can leverage labeled datasets, also known as supervised learning, to inform its algorithm, but it doesn’t necessarily require a labeled dataset. It can ingest unstructured data in its raw form (e.g. text, images), and it can automatically determine the hierarchy of features which distinguish different categories of data from one another. Unlike machine learning, it doesn't require human intervention to process data, allowing us to scale machine learning in more interesting ways.
