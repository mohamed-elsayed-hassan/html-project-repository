 <h2>Is AI getting better results or dominating the workplace?: </h2>
 For a long time we believed that the entry of artificial intelligence into our lives would enable it to gradually control it until we live in a world controlled by machines, or perhaps that was the image that Hollywood films conveyed to us about artificial intelligence and made us believe it
 
That idea has continued to grow as artificial intelligence and robotics automation enter the workplace, and many feel that their jobs are under threat, and that robots may take over their work and leave huge numbers of people without work, while others are looking forward to the quality that self-driving vehicles and automated home appliances bring to their lives. family life.

The truth is that we are still far from either of these scenes, despite the use and rapid application of this technology, but what does that mean for us now? How much will our lives change in the near future? Here, we'll look at the key elements of success when using AI and automation in our work.
